Workshop instructions may at times have you run a command which does not complete immediately, and which will continue to run until interrupted. Click on the sleep command below to setup such a case.

```execute
sleep 3600
```

You could select the appropriate terminal yourself and enter `<ctrl-c>` yourself to interrupt the command, but even this may be automated.

```execute
<ctrl-c>
```

When this special value is used as the command, it doesn't mean you need to enter it. Click on this and it will instead send the appropriate key sequence to interrupt the command for you.
