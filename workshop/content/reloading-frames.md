Especially when doing workshops at conferences, internet access can be unreliable. If at any time during a workshop session the dashboard doesn't display the workshop content correctly, the browser shows a network error, or the terminals show as having being closed, **do not** refresh the whole browser page. If you refresh the whole browser page, you will end up back at the start of the workshop content and will loose where you were up to. Similarly, if for the workshop an embedded web console for OpenShift is being used, you will loose which page you were on.

To reload the workshop content, terminals, or embedded web console, select the hamburger menu at top right in the banner above the terminals. From the drop down menu, select 'Reload Workshop', 'Reload Terminal' or 'Reload Console' as necessary. Select each of these in turn to test that they work.

Do not select the 'Restart Session' option of the menu unless instructed to as that will normally reset your whole workshop session and delete it. This will result in you needing to start over and all progress will be lost.
