Workshop content can contain commands which need to be executed in one of the terminals. These commands are shown as a code block with the play symbol
<span class="fas fa-play-circle"></span> appearing to the right hand side.

```execute-1
echo 'Run in the upper terminal'
```

Click anywhere on the highlighted code block above. When this is done, the command should be copied to the terminal and run. The colour of the symbol should also change indicating you had clicked on it.

There is therefore no need to type the commands in yourself. If you want, you can select a terminal and type in your own commands, but it is recommended that for the commands that the workshop specifies should be run, that you click on it to have it run for you and so avoid any mistakes. It will also save you lots of time.

Where a workshop uses multiple terminals, you don't need to determine which terminal the command should be run in, the workshop content will make this choice for you.

Click on the command below and it should be run in the lower terminal instead of the default upper terminal.

```execute-2
echo 'Run in the lower terminal'
```
